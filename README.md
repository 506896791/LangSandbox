# LangSandbox

This project is used to illustrate how to build a programming language. The code present here is discussed in a series of articles

1. [Define the lexer](http://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-antlr-building-a-simple-expression-language/)
2. [Define the parser](http://tomassetti.me/building-and-testing-a-parser-with-antlr-and-kotlin/)
3. [Build an editor with syntax highlighting]() (the code for this part is in [this project](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas))
4. [Build an editor with autocompletion]() (the code for this part is in [this project](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas))
5. Map the parse tree to the abstract syntax tree (to be published)
6. Transform the abstract syntax tree (to be published)
7. Validate the abstract syntax tree (to be published)
8. Generate bytecode (to be published)
