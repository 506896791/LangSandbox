# LangSandbox

This project is used to illustrate how to build a programming language. The code present here is discussed in a series of articles

1. [Define the lexer](http://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-antlr-building-a-simple-expression-language/)
2. [Define the parser](http://tomassetti.me/building-and-testing-a-parser-with-antlr-and-kotlin/)
3. [Build an editor with syntax highlighting]() (the code for this part is in [this project](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas))
4. [Build an editor with autocompletion]() (the code for this part is in [this project](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas))
