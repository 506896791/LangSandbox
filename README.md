# LangSandbox

This project is used to illustrate how to build a programming language. The code present here is discussed in a series of articles.

From these series of tutorials I derived a [book on creating languages](https://leanpub.com/create_languages).


You may be interested in the companion project ([Kanvas](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas)) where we show how to build an editor for your language.

1. [Define the lexer](http://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-antlr-building-a-simple-expression-language/)
2. [Define the parser](http://tomassetti.me/building-and-testing-a-parser-with-antlr-and-kotlin/)
3. [Build an editor with syntax highlighting]() (the code for this part is in [this project](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas))
4. [Build an editor with autocompletion]() (the code for this part is in [this project](https://github.com/ftomassetti/kanvas))
5. [Map the parse tree to the abstract syntax tree](http://tomassetti.me/parse-tree-abstract-syntax-tree/)
6. [Transform the abstract syntax tree](http://tomassetti.me/model-to-model-transformations/)
7. [Validate the abstract syntax tree](http://tomassetti.me/building-compiler-language-validation/)
8. [Generate bytecode](http://tomassetti.me/generating-bytecode/)

I hope you enjoy and please let me know if you have issues, ideas, comments or any sort of feedback!
